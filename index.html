      <p>My Safa,</p>
      <p>
        Even though thousands of kilometers separate us, my heart remains deeply connected to yours.
        I miss your laughter, your stories, and the sound of your voice that always soothes me.
        Every second here in Indonesia, you're on my mind — like a star that shines even behind the clouds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for always being there, even from afar. You make me feel loved, even across this distance.
        I look forward to the day when we no longer count time zones, when I can hold you close without limits.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Because I love you. Always.</strong></p>

        in every thought, in every little thing I do.
      </p>
      <p>You are loved. Deeply.</p>
